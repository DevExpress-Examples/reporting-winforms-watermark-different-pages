# Reporting for WinForms - How to Add Different Watermarks to Different Pages

This example shows how to assign a unique watermark to different report pages. You can do it the following ways:

*  Assign the [Page.WatermarkId](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Page.WatermarkId?v=23.2) property to the [Watermark.Id](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Drawing.Watermark.Id?v=23.2) value. 

* Call the [Page.AssignWatermark](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Page.AssignWatermark(DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Drawing.PageWatermark)) method for the page whose watermark you want to change, and pass a new watermark to this method as a parameter. 

`Page.AssignWatermark` takes priority over `Page.WatermarkId`.

If you want to remove the watermark from a particular page, pass a new empty watermark to the [AssignWatermark](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Page.AssignWatermark(DevExpress.XtraPrinting.Drawing.PageWatermark)) method.
